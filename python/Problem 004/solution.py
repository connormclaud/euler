# Task description:
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

#usually person brute force this by iterating all products of
# three digits numbers and checking whether it is palindrome or not
# I don't like this approach. I will generate all 6-digit palindromes
# then factoring it
